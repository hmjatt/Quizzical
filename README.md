## About ℹ️

**`Quizzical`** is a _Trivia_ game implemented in `ReactJS`. While creating this project I learned about `Event Listeners in React`, `React State`, `Conditional Rendering in React`, `React Hooks(useEffect)`, etc. A player is given _5 random questions_ with _4 choices_ each. Trivia questions are retrieved from [_Open Trivia Database API_](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php). A participant can _validate_ their answers and can play as many times as they want. Have Fun :smile:. After creating the project, it was deployed to `GitHub Pages` :bird: Feel free to reach me on[Twitter](https://twitter.com/hmjatt/) 👾
